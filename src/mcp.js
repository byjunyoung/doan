Screens only arrange things; this step decides what the things look like. Work in this order and do not skip a step.

1. Anchor. Call list_tokens and list_components. Open foundations.html in the viewer (render if needed) and say in two lines what the product looks like now — the bundled defaults are not a decision.

2. Read the reference, if there is one, and name what it decides, in words a designer would use: the surfaces (what a box is made of — fill, border or none, radius, shadow), the type (families, the contrast of weights and sizes, line height), the colour roles (brand, the one call to action, promotion, danger, text, muted), density (how much air), how pictures are treated (cut-out, full bleed, on a tint), icons (stroke or fill, weight). Separate what is the reference's brand from what is its system — copy the system, not the brand.

3. List what has to be decided, numbered, before asking anything: palette and roles, text styles (display, heading, title, body, label, caption — sizes, weights, line heights), surfaces (page, card, tile, raised, sunken — whichever the product needs), radius and space scales, control heights, shadows, fonts to load, pictures and icons.

4. Ask one at a time, each with a recommendation from the reference or the platform's conventions (touch targets 44pt / 48dp or more on a kiosk; body text 16px or more at arm's length) and a line on why. Wait for each answer.

5. Show the decisions as a table — item | decision | why — and, as text, a small specimen: each text style on one line with its numbers, each surface in words.

6. Only then write the token files — primitives (the palette and scales) in one file, the semantic names (color roles, text.* as DTCG typography, surface.* as groups of bg, border, radius, shadow, text, padding, control.*) in others, per theme when there are themes — and call propose_files with all of them, the summary in the person's words and the decisions. If contracts should bind the new styles (font: text.label, surface: surface.tile), include those files in the same proposal.

7. Tell the person to open the proposal page: the foundations board as it is beside as it would be. Wait. They apply or reject; you do not call apply. For changes, go back to the step the change belongs to.

Never invent a brand the person did not give. Where a value is a guess, say so in the decisions table.`,

          text: `You are about to design or change the component "${kind}"${request ? ` because the person asked: "${request}"` : ''}. Work in this order and do not skip a step.

1. Anchor. Call list_components and list_tokens. If a kind close to this one exists, say which and whether extending it (a new variant, a new prop) is better than a new kind — ask before making a new one.

2. List what has to be decided, numbered: what it is for, one line; its parts (which existing kinds it is built from — a compound contract draws the tree it declares); its props, with types, defaults and enum options; the variants and what each changes; the slots other elements fill; the bindings — for the box (bg, border, radius, padding, gap, shadow, min-height, or a whole surface: surface.x) and for each part (label.text, label.font: text.x); how it maps to the team's code (maps_to.code: import, name, props, values); its sample.

3. Ask one at a time, each with a recommendation from the sibling kinds and the foundations board, and a line on why. Wait for each answer.

4. Show the decisions as a table, and the component as a text sketch — one per variant that looks different.

5. Only then write components/${kind}.yaml — props, slots, tokens, variants, elements and layout for a compound, sample — and call propose_files with it (and any token it needs), the summary in the person's words and the decisions.

6. Tell the person to open the proposal page: the foundations board shows the component in each variant, as it is beside as it would be. Wait for their answer; you do not call apply.

A binding names a semantic token, never a primitive (L19); a part named in a binding must be one the contract declares (L28).`,

          text: `You are about to draw or change the screen "${screen}"${request ? ` because the person asked: "${request}"` : ''}. Work in this order and do not skip a step.

1. Anchor. Call list_screens, then get_screen for "${screen}" if it exists and for its nearest relative if it does not (same section, same type). If the product's look is not defined yet (foundations.html shows only the bundled defaults), say so and suggest the foundation prompt first. Call list_components — the kinds you may use and the props, slots and enum options each declares; nothing else goes on an element; maps_to.code is what a kind is in the team's code, which the handoff spec will quote — and list_tokens — the semantic tokens a layout may name; never a primitive — and list_assets — the files under assets/ a screen may name by path (src on an image, icon on any kind); never invent a path. Read conventions: the required states for its type, the layout vocabulary, and breakpoints — a screen that must work at several widths gets a breakpoints block (patches per name, applied last) and layout that adapts on its own (columns: auto with min, wrap, scroll: horizontal). New work inherits the shell every screen in the section shares.

1½. Pattern first. Call list_patterns. Inconsistency is rarely carelessness — it is what happens when there was nothing to refer to. For each part being arranged (the frame of the screen, a list row, where back and the main action sit, an empty panel), one of three:
   a. A pattern binds this screen → follow its skeleton and its notes; say which you follow.
   b. No pattern, but two or more screens already do it the same way → that is an unwritten pattern: propose it as patterns/<name>.yaml with propose_files, say which screens it will bind, and take its own yes before drawing from it.
   c. Nothing anywhere → a new pattern binds every screen after this one, so it is not a detail of this screen: propose it on its own, say what it binds, and wait.
   The screen proposal comes after the pattern is settled, never in the same step.

2. List what has to be decided, numbered, before asking anything — so the person sees the size of it. Typical items: which elements, which columns or fields, which states beyond the required ones, where each action leads, what the empty and error copy says, what stays out of scope.

3. Ask one at a time. Each question gets two or three lines of context and a recommended option, based on the file's own precedent (how the sibling screens do it) rather than taste. Wait for the answer before the next question. If an answer opens a question the list did not have, ask that one next.

4. When everything is settled, show a table — item | decision | why — and the list of states the screen will have, one line each on what changes from Default.

5. Sketch before any YAML. In the conversation, draw the Default state as a text wireframe — a box drawing at the platform's proportions, every element in its place with its real label — and under it one line per other state on what the picture changes. Wait for a yes. If the person wants something moved, fix the sketch and show it again; a wireframe is cheaper to argue with than a diff.

6. Only then write the whole screen file and call propose with the complete YAML, a one-line summary in the person's words, the decisions table from step 4 as the decisions argument, and the ids of the comments this version answers as comments — applying it resolves them. Then call render with that proposal id and give the person the page path: it shows the agreed decisions, what changes, and every state AS-IS beside TO-BE.

7. Wait. The person applies or rejects; you do not call apply yourself. If they ask for changes, go back to the sketch and propose again — the earlier proposal stays pending until it is rejected.

8. When the person says the screen is done for developers, propose status: ready (a text change) and point them at the spec: the handoff tool, or spec-<screen>.html in the viewer. A ready screen with a $tbd left is L27.

Copy comes from the spec the screen references, from sibling screens, or from the person; where none of those gives a value, write { $tbd: { owner: ... } } instead of something plausible. A value nobody decided is not a design decision.`,
