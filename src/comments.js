// A comment is anchored to a screen and an element — by the element's id, because a YAML path
// (`elements.1`) moves the moment something is inserted above it, and a comment that points at
// the wrong element is worse than none. The path and line are derived from the id every time
// the comment is read, so they always say where the element is now; a comment whose element
// is gone keeps its last path and is marked orphan. A comment on something that is not an
// element (a state, a layout key) keeps its path as written. Comments live in
// <project>/.comments/<screen>.json: a file per screen, so they travel with the branch and the
// local viewer, the MCP server and a hosted viewer all read one store.
