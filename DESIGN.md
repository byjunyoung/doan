# Doan — a design tool where the agent holds the pen

Status: design v0.2.1, code 0.21.0 · 2026-10-04 · license MIT · home github.com/byjunyoung/doan · named doan (도안) on 2026-09-24.

What runs: `lint` (schema + L01–L30), `prep`, `diff` (files or git refs), `render` and the live viewer `serve` (bundled component set, antd or MUI), `import figma` / `map figma`, as a CLI and as an MCP server on stdio (`mcp`); the edit loop as `propose` → `apply` / `reject` / `undo` with text-only auto-apply. Not yet: hosting (the local viewer is the seed), and the verbs §9 marks *planned*.

v0.1 (same day) framed this as a management layer that leaves drawing to other canvases. That was the author's reading, not the owner's. The intent is a tool a product team opens **instead of Figma** for its screens. v0.2 keeps v0.1's engine — the model, the checks, the lifecycle — and puts the product on top of it. Every decision carries a one-line *why*; one team's habit appears only as an example and ships as `null`.

## 1. What this is

A design tool for product screens in which **the agent draws and humans review, comment and ask. Nobody drags.** A screen is a file the agent writes; the tool renders it with the team's real components, shows every state side by side, checks what is missing, and hands it to engineering. Editing is a conversation, anchored to the element you are looking at.

Three products already let an agent draw. What they are, and where this differs:

- **Claude Design** (Anthropic Labs, 2026-04): prompt → prototype, edited by inline comments, direct text edit and sliders. It launched without a drag canvas — the same bet as here — and has had drag, resize and align since 2026-06-17 ([Anthropic, 2026-06-17](https://claude.com/blog/claude-design-stays-on-brand-for-daily-work)); since 2026-09-16 it lives inside Claude, in an ordinary conversation ([Magic Patterns, 2026-09-25](https://www.magicpatterns.com/blog/claude-design-now-lives-inside-claude)). What still differs is what this holds and a generator does not: states as required objects per screen, lint for what is missing, a git lifecycle, and any agent as the pen. It is a generator; this is a file of record for a team.
- **Paper** (alpha): HTML/CSS *is* the canvas, with bidirectional MCP — but a hand-driven canvas with an agent attached. This has no hand canvas at all.
- **pen.dev / OpenPencil**: a geometric `.pen`/`.op` document in the repo, agent-editable, hand-editable, IDE-native. A better Figma for developers; still a canvas.

What none of them hold, and this does: states per screen as required objects, a lint that says what is missing, a canonical/working lifecycle, and a handoff a developer can inspect at the component level. The engine of v0.1 is the differentiation; the viewer is the product.

### 1.1 Will Claude Design simply do this better?

At drawing a screen from a prompt — yes, and it will stay ahead; a generator built by the model's maker is not a fight to pick. So this project does not compete on generation at all. The agent that draws sits outside the tool (§7); Claude Code, Codex or Claude Design's own output can be the pen. What this holds is the layer a generator does not: the screen as a team's file of record, the check for what is missing, the lifecycle, the handoff. An editor, however good, does not make git unnecessary.

| | Claude Design (2026-10) | here |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | drag, resize, align (since 2026-06-17), inside Claude (since 2026-09-16) | none on purpose: the agent places, a person proposes a layout value from the file's vocabulary (§6) |
| States per screen | not an object of the format | required per type, linted |
| What is missing | not checked | lint, with file and line |
| Versions and lifecycle | not git | git: branch = working, PR = queue, main = canonical |
| Where the result lives | a project on Anthropic's servers | YAML in the team's repo |
| Which agent | Claude | any, over MCP |

(Rows corrected 2026-10-04: the 2026-09 table said "no drag canvas"; it has one.)

The risk is plain: the left column can be filled by Anthropic at will, versions and collaboration first. The bet is that "the team's file is in git and the agent is swappable" is a direction a model vendor has little reason to take. Open format, git-native, agent-neutral is the ground this stands on.

Rather than compete, the tool will take Claude Design as input: an `import html` adapter (§9, planned) that reads the HTML it exports and produces screen files — `kind` by reverse `maps_to` on the component markup, layout from the flexbox/grid structure, the rest as `$tbd`. Claude Design becomes one front end among several; the question changes from "which draws better" to "where does the drawing live".

## 2. What Figma does for a product team, and what replaces it

"Replace Figma" is only honest as a table. This tool replaces Figma **for product screens**. Decks, FigJam diagrams, vector and illustration, marketing assets are out — a team keeps Figma or something else for those, and `fig:deck` in particular still depends on Figma Slides.

| Figma job | Here | v0 |
|---|---|---|
| Draw a screen | The agent writes the screen file; `render` draws it with real components | In |
| Look at screens | A canvas per domain: sections side by side, a column per screen with its states stacked, arrows between them, at real size with zoom and pan (§6.6). Then a screen page with its states side by side | In (0.7) |
| Components & tokens | The team's code components and tokens, used directly. No Figma-side copy to keep in sync | In |
| Variants / states | `states:` in the file, required per screen type, checked by lint | In |
| Prototype links | `flows:` are links; the rendered screen is clickable | In |
| Dev Mode (inspect, measure, copy) | The render is real HTML/CSS built from the production component library; inspect props, not pixels | In |
| Comments | Anchored to an element (a YAML path); the agent reads them and proposes the change | In |
| Version history / branching | git. Working = branch, review = PR, canonical = main | In |
| Share link | Fixed URL per screen, state and version | In (hosted) |
| Find what is missing | Not in Figma. `lint` runs on every change | In |
| Hand-drag layout, pixel nudging | Out, on purpose (§6) | Out |
| Vector, illustration, icons | Out — icons come from the component library | Out |
| Slides, FigJam, marketing | Out | Out |
| Realtime multiplayer cursors | Out; collaboration is comments + PRs, not cursors | Out |
| Export to Figma / `.pen` / `.op` | Kept as one adapter, for teams that still need a canvas for something else. Not a pillar | later |

## 3. The model

Seven objects, unchanged from v0.1 except that a screen now carries its own presentation.

```
Project
 └─ Section            "03. Orders - Order list"
     └─ Screen         order-list · type: list   (status derived from git, §8)
         ├─ Element    id · kind · props · children       (the Default state)
         ├─ Layout     structure of the Default state, token-based, never px   (new in v0.2)
         ├─ Variant    what the screen *is* for this record or mode — axes, one option each, patches   (new in v0.2.1)
         ├─ State      what it is *doing* — Empty · Loading · Error … a patch on elements and layout
         ├─ Flow       from element[.anchor] → to screen[.state] · when
         ├─ Ref        prd: · task: · design: · file:     (typed URIs)
         └─ Decision   every value is set | $tbd{owner, due}
```

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Depth of an element | Shallow: `kind` + props, no geometry | Agents write and diff it reliably; the component library decides how a table looks. |
| **Presentation** | A `layout:` block — stack / grid / columns, alignment, size classes, spacing by **token name**, never raw px | Now that no canvas holds the arrangement, the agent's visual decisions must persist or every re-render loses them. Structure and tokens survive a design-system change and read in a diff; `px: 372` does neither. |
| How a state is stored | A patch on Default (`replace` / `hide` / `set`), for elements and layout alike | The reviewer's question is "what changes here", and a patch is that answer. |
| **Variants vs states** | `variants:` — named axes (`item_type`, `mode`), each with two or more options, each option a patch list; a view is Default → one option per axis, in declared order → the state | The field test (§12) found three screens whose "states" were really what the screen *is* for the record (a counted item, Edit mode), not what it is *doing*. Mixing them made `required` states meaningless and `known` a dumping ground. Same patch shape, so nothing new to learn. |
| Vocabulary of `kind` | Own small list, each with `maps_to` per design system | Screen files must survive a Bootstrap → antd move (happened 2026-09). |
| **Platform** | `platform:` on a screen, `platforms.default` in conventions; each platform has a width, an optional height and a frame (`none`, `phone`, `tablet`) | Screens are web or app. A kiosk platform shipped in 0.1.3 and was taken out (2026-09-24): it was only a portrait frame with no kiosk kinds, so naming it beside web and app promised more than it drew. The model never depended on a platform; the picture did — so the platform decides the frame and the width, the way `type` decides the required states. A per-screen field, because one project holds an admin web and a customer app of the same product. |
| Flow gestures and navigation | `gesture` and `nav` on a flow, vocabularies in `conventions.flows`, L16 | A tap and a swipe are different design facts; "push" and "sheet" change what the next screen looks like. Words the machine can read, not prose in `when`. |
| Identity | References use the `screen` name; a stable `id` exists only for `diff` pairing across renames; `rename` rewrites references | Humans and agents read `to: order-detail` without a lookup; lint L05 names any reference `rename` missed. |
| Undecided values | `{ $tbd: { owner, due } }`, a plain mapping under a reserved key | Visibly different from empty; survives every parser and JSON Schema; a YAML tag fails all four. |
| References | Typed URIs (`notion:`, `github:owner/repo#12`, `figma:`, `file:`) | A fixed pair would assume Notion and GitHub. |
| Screen type → required states | A table in conventions, three example rows | The `fig` rule that caught the most missing work; a team with no rows gets no check, not a wrong one. |

Why not adopt `.pen`, `.op` or AI Design Canvas's document: all three are geometry-first (frames, shapes, auto-layout) — checked 2026-09-23; none has states-per-screen, flows or lifecycle as first-class objects. Adopting one makes this a plugin of that canvas.

## 4. The file format

One screen, one file, YAML, validated by JSON Schema.

```
design/
├── conventions.yaml     naming, screen types, kinds, refs, lifecycle, layout vocabulary
├── tokens/              DTCG 2025.10 files and a resolver (§4.4); a flat tokens.json from before 0.3 still reads
├── sections.yaml        "03. Orders - Order list" and their order
└── screens/
    ├── order-list.yaml
    └── order-detail.yaml
```

### 4.1 A screen file

```yaml
schema: doan/0.2
id: scr_01J8K3                       # stable; only `diff` reads it
screen: order-list                   # the name every reference uses
section: "03. Orders - Order list"
type: list                           # decides required states
refs:                                # a map, one typed URI per key
  prd: notion:2a1f0d…
  task: github:acme/task-management#4155

elements:                            # the Default state
  - id: header
    kind: page-header
    title: Orders
    actions: [{ id: export, kind: button, label: Export, variant: secondary }]
  - id: filter
    kind: filter-form
    fields: [period, branch, status]
  - id: table
    kind: table
    columns: [order_no, branch, amount, status, ordered_at]
  - id: paging
    kind: pagination

layout:                              # structure, tokens, size classes — never px
  root: { kind: stack, direction: column, gap: space.lg, padding: space.xl }
  header: { align: space-between }
  filter: { kind: grid, columns: 3, gap: space.md }
  table: { grow: true }
  paging: { align: end }

states:                              # patches on elements and layout
  Empty:
    - { target: table, replace: { kind: empty-notice, text: "No orders match." } }
    - { target: paging, hide: true }
  Loading:
    - { target: table, replace: { kind: skeleton, rows: 10 } }
  Error:
    - { target: table, replace: { kind: error-notice, text: { $tbd: { owner: pm, due: 2026-10-02 } } } }

flows:
  - { from: table, via: row, to: order-detail }
  - { from: filter, to: order-list.Empty, when: "0 results", style: conditional }

notes:
  - The branch column is hidden for single-branch accounts.
```

`layout` vocabulary (`stack`, `grid`, `columns`, `align`, `grow`, size classes `sm|md|lg|full`) and the token names it may use are declared in `conventions.yaml`; lint L13 rejects anything else, and in particular any bare number with a unit.

### 4.2 Variants

```yaml
variants:                  # applied before any state, in the order the axes are declared
  item_type:
    Other: []              # an option may be empty; it still names the case
    Counted:
      - { target: level, replace: { kind: input, readonly: true } }
    CupLid:
      - { target: refill, hide: true }
  mode:
    Create: [{ target: delete, hide: true }]
    Edit:   [{ target: dialog, set: { title: Edit notice } }]
```

An axis needs two or more options (L15); one option is a state or a note. Option names must not shadow a state name (L15). Flows target `screen.State`, never a variant — a variant is chosen by the data, not reached by an action. `mergeState(screen, state, { item_type: 'CupLid', mode: 'Edit' })` gives the view.

### 4.3 conventions.yaml

The semantic half of `fig`'s `figma-conventions.yaml`, plus the layout vocabulary. Pixel values from `fig` (section gaps, arrow strokes) do not come along; they belong to the Figma export adapter if anyone builds one.

```yaml
naming:
  screen_pattern: '^[a-z0-9-]+$'
  section_pattern: null                         # example: '^\d{2}\. .+ - .+$'
states:
  known: [Default, Empty, Loading, Error, Validation, Selected]
  required:                                     # examples; a team writes its own rows
    list:   [Default, Empty, Loading, Error]
    form:   [Default, Validation]
    search: [Default, Empty]
# kinds are files — components/<kind>.yaml (§4.5). A kinds: block here still reads, as legacy; L23 asks to move it
layout:
  containers: [stack, grid, columns]
  spacing_tokens: 'space.'                      # prefix; only names starting with it may appear in layout
  size_classes: [sm, md, lg, full]
tokens:
  primitive: [primitive]                        # file stems under tokens/ a screen must never name (L19)
refs:
  required: []                                  # example: [prd]
  schemes: [notion, github, figma, file, https]
lifecycle:
  canonical_branch: main
  handoff_requires: [lint:blocking=0]
edit:
  auto_apply: [text]                            # which comment-driven changes skip preview (§7)
```

### 4.4 Tokens

```
design/tokens/
├── primitive.tokens.json   the palette and the scale — gray.900, blue.500, size.4
├── semantic.tokens.json    what does not change with the theme: space.md → {size.4}, radius, font
├── light.tokens.json       colour in the light theme: color.bg → {gray.0}
├── dark.tokens.json        colour in the dark theme: color.bg → {gray.900}
└── theme.resolver.json     sets, modifiers, resolutionOrder — how the files combine
```

Decided 2026-09-24, one question at a time, when the owner set the goal that doan carries everything the `fig` plugin used to keep in Figma — the design system, the components, the whole flow — not screens alone:

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Format | DTCG Format 2025.10 — `$value`, `$type`, `{alias}`, `$extends` | the first stable version of the spec; Figma Variables and Style Dictionary speak it, so tokens come in and go out without a converter of ours. Colour `$value` is an object (`colorSpace`, `components`, `hex`) and dimension is `{ value, unit }`; the loader turns both into css strings |
| Tiers | two — primitive → semantic | primitives are the design system's private vocabulary; screens and components name the semantic layer only. A third tier (component tokens) was judged too much for a small team — add a file when a team needs it |
| How a tier is marked | by file — `conventions.tokens.primitive` lists the stems | a name prefix (`primitive.blue.500`) would have changed every reference; a file boundary is visible in `ls` and in git |
| Names in screens | unchanged — `space.md`, as before | zero edits to existing screens and to the field-test project; the flat `tokens.json` from before 0.3 still reads (`source: flat`, no tiers) |
| Modes | DTCG Resolver — `theme.resolver.json` with sets, modifiers, contexts, resolutionOrder | the same document the spec's tooling exchanges; light/dark is a modifier, not a copy of the file. Spacing, radius and type sit in one set for every context, only colour is per theme, so nothing is repeated |

What the engine does with them: `loadTokens` resolves the default context into the nested shape render always read (`space.md` → `--space-md`) and every other context into its own set; `render` emits `:root[data-theme="dark"] { … }` per context and a select in the header that sets the attribute on `<html>`; `list_tokens` (verb and MCP tool) gives an agent every name with its value, its per-context values, its file and its tier before it names one. Lint: L18 a layout names a token that resolves to nothing; L19 a layout names a primitive; L20 whatever the loader could not resolve — a broken alias, a `$ref` it could not open, a token one theme defines and another does not. Nothing in the loader throws on a bad token; every miss is a finding with a file and a path.

Known limit: a component library adapter (antd, MUI) is themed at render time from the default context. The mode select recolours the bundled kinds and the page chrome, not the library's own pieces. Rendering once per context would close that at the cost of one server-side pass per theme — §13.

### 4.5 Components

```
design/components/
├── button.yaml        a bundled kind's contract: props, enum options, token slots, per-variant bindings
├── table.yaml         anchors and maps_to live here too — the file is the registry entry
├── menu-card.yaml     a compound part: props, a slot, and the elements it is drawn from
└── kinds.js           only with --base none: the drawing set, still yours
```

Decided 2026-09-24, right after the token stage, one question at a time:

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Where a kind is declared | one file per kind under `components/`; `conventions.kinds` is gone from `init` and from the examples | the owner chose the full move over keeping two places. A file is a thing a team owns and edits; a row in conventions was the tool's. A `kinds:` block still reads, as legacy — L23 (one line per project) and `doan migrate kinds` move it |
| What a contract holds | `props` (type, required, default, enum options), `slots`, `anchors`, `maps_to`, `tokens` (slot → semantic token), `variants` (bindings per enum option), `sample`, and for a compound part `elements` + `layout` | the facts a Figma component carries — properties, variants, the tokens it is bound to — as text a diff can read |
| Bindings reach the picture | `tokens:` becomes `--k-<kind>-<slot>` custom properties on the element's wrapper, a variant's on `[data-<prop>="<option>"]`; the bundled css reads them with fallbacks. The slots are `bg`, `text`, `border`, `radius`, `padding`, `gap`, `accent`, `muted` and, since 0.12, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `min-height`, `shadow` — one list, `src/slots.js`. Type reaches a bundled piece by inheritance from its wrapper; height and shadow the set reads kind by kind (button, card, image, modal); a root an adapter drew gets every bound slot applied from outside. L28 warns on any other name | the owner chose "in the picture" over "recorded and checked": change `button.yaml` and every button changes, as a library component would. Namespaced by kind so a card's padding never leaks into the button inside it; written as `var(--token)` so a theme switch flows through |
| What an instance may set | only declared props and slots. L21 warns on anything else; L22 blocks a missing required prop, an option the kind lacks, a slot it does not declare | the owner's rule: the screen holds the instance, the contract holds the part. A patch cannot reach inside — children are `<instance>/<child>`, a shape the screen schema forbids |
| A compound's look (0.13.1) | its `tokens`/`variants` paint the wrapper box (bg, border, radius, padding, shadow, min-height, type) and `child.slot` bindings re-bind a declared part's own variable with more weight than the part's contract — a selected tile's label turns white | a design system's variant reaches into its sub-parts; without this a compound was a bare group and its children ignored it |
| Composition | `elements:` in the contract; `$name` is a prop's value, `${name}` its text inside a string, `{ slot: name }` a slot; a `show_when` that names a prop is settled; expanded after `mergeState`, before render | a state patch that sets a prop is what the tree sees; the inspector on an expanded child names the component file, not the screen |
| Required props | rare in the bundled set — a button's label, a caption's text, a field's label; never a list | a Figma import produces kinds without props; blocking every imported table on a missing columns list would fail the on-ramp on day one |

What the engine does with them: `loadComponents` reads `components/*.yaml` (and the legacy rows) into `project.components`; lint, render, `map figma` and `import figma` read only that. The viewer's **Components** page draws every contract from its `sample` — one picture, and one more per option of every prop with variant bindings — beside its props, slots and bindings; `list_components` (verb and MCP tool) is the same list as JSON, and the `draw` prompt reads it before naming a kind. `init` copies the bundled contracts into the project with `maps_to` trimmed to the chosen base.

Known limits: a library adapter (antd, MUI) draws from the props its own code reads — a contract's bindings and enum options do not reach it (§13). The shipped contracts were gated against five real projects (three examples, two field projects) for zero L21 before shipping; a prop a team uses that the bundled contract lacks is a one-line edit to a file they own, which is the point.

### 4.6 Assets

The person's own files — icons, photos, illustrations — live under `assets/` (svg, png, jpg, gif, webp, avif, any depth). A screen names one by path from the project directory: `src: assets/photos/menu.jpg` on an image, `icon: assets/icons/cart.svg` on any kind that takes an icon. Anything else in `icon` stays a glyph, so the two coexist. The tool never copies or renames a file: the bundled set draws it as it is (an `<img>`), `serve` answers `/assets/…` from the folder and nothing outside it, `render` copies the folder next to the pages, `doan init` creates it. L25 warns when a path names no file; the assets page (§6.9) says who uses what, what is missing and what nothing names. Decided 2026-09-24, when the owner asked for a place to see the design system's files and not only its tokens and components. Known limit: an SVG drawn through `<img>` cannot take the text colour — an inline-SVG option with `fill: currentColor` is a §13 item.

### 4.7 Responsive: breakpoints and layout that adapts on its own

A screen that must work at several widths keeps one file. Two things make it responsive, decided 2026-09-25 when the owner asked to "do responsive properly", against what Figma offers — a frame per breakpoint kept by hand, auto layout with min/max and wrap inside one frame ([Design+Code](https://designcode.io/figma-responsive-layouts-adaptive-design/), [moonlearning](https://www.moonlearning.io/responsive-figma)), and in Figma Sites a component variant per breakpoint name ([Figma Help](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/31242826664983-Create-a-responsive-component-that-automatically-adapts-to-each-breakpoint)).

**Breakpoints are patches.** `conventions.breakpoints` names the widths (`mobile: 390`, `tablet: 768`, `desktop: 1280` in the example). A screen opts in with a `breakpoints:` block: per name, the same patch list a state uses (`set`, `replace`, `hide`, `layout`), applied last — after the variant and the state — because the viewport is the outermost fact about a view; the same Empty state, narrower. A name the conventions do not know is L26; a patch whose target does not exist is L07 like any other; a patch layout that names no token is L18 like any other. The frame per breakpoint a Figma file kept by hand is what the viewer *draws*: the screen page gets a tab per named width beside the state tabs, each a frame at that width with the patches applied; the prototype gets a breakpoint select and a view per breakpoint for the screens that have one (the base view stands in for the rest); the canvas draws the base width only — a domain page three times wider would say less, not more. One file per breakpoint was rejected for the reason Figma users know: the copies drift.

**Where things sit (0.13.0).** Two words on fixed axes: `align` is horizontal and `justify` is vertical, whatever the container's direction — a person reads a screen that way, and the kiosk's completion screen had `align: center` on a column meaning "centre it" while the engine read the flex main axis. `columns` may be the tracks themselves (`"1fr auto auto"`) so a row's cells line up. Found by filling the kiosk in: what looked unfinished was composition, and composition was outside the vocabulary.

**What a column does with no alignment (0.20.0).** A vertical stack that names no `align` lets its children take the width (`stretch`) — as the screen's root and a compound's box always did. A `group` alone used to centre them, so the same rule meant two things by where it sat, and a row inside a column (a card's title with its number at the far right) could not spread out. A leaf's own `align` is its text alignment (`intro: { align: center }`), which was already there and is now written down. Found by writing the portfolio site as files, where every card's text sat in the middle.

**Layout that adapts without a breakpoint.** Three words joined the layout vocabulary for the cases the field test hit (§12, row 6): `columns: auto` with `min: <size class>` — as many columns as fit, each at least that wide (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(var(--size-sm), 1fr))`); `wrap: true` on a stack or row; `scroll: horizontal` — the children keep their width and the container scrolls sideways. The last two apply to a leaf kind that draws its own row (a stat strip) as much as to a container. For a developer these are CSS one to one; for a designer they are what auto layout's wrap and min width mean. One thing to know when writing a breakpoint patch: a leaf kind that draws its own inside — a tile grid, a table — takes its columns from its own props, so the patch is `set: { columns: 10 }`, not `layout: { columns: 10 }`; `layout` speaks to containers and to the wrap and scroll words.

A contract is the one truth about a kind (0.10.1, after the owner's review found three): every element is drawn with its contract applied first — a default for each prop it left out, an enum value the contract does not list replaced by the declared default — whether the bundled set or a library adapter draws it, and the contract's token bindings reach an adapter-drawn root as CSS (`.el-<kind>[data-drawn] > *` reads the same `--k-<kind>-<slot>` variables). The bundled drawings keep fallbacks of their own only for a project with no contract at all.

### 4.8 Patterns: how the parts are arranged

Decided 2026-09-28, after the kiosk's five screens each invented their own bottom bar — a summary and a small button on two, two full-width buttons on two, nothing on the payment screen — and the owner asked whether doan needed what `fig:draw` has: a pattern page. It did. The design system had the parts (tokens, contracts) and the screens had the result; the rule in between, *how the parts are arranged here*, lived nowhere, so every screen made it up. Inconsistency is rarely carelessness: it is what happens when there was nothing to refer to.

| Layer | What lives there | The question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Foundations (`tokens/`) | colours, type, surfaces | what does the product look like |
| Components (`components/`) | the parts | what does a button look like |
| **Patterns (`patterns/`)** | **how the parts are arranged** | **what closes every screen; where back goes** |
| Screens (`screens/`) | the result | what is on this screen |

```yaml
# patterns/screen-frame.yaml
pattern: screen-frame
description: every screen is three parts — header / body / bar
applies_to: { except: [kiosk-option] }        # types · platforms · screens · except
skeleton:                                      # the top-level elements, in order — L29 checks this
  - { role: header, kind: [page-header, group] }
  - { role: body, kind: any, many: true }      # many: one or more; optional: may be absent
  - { role: bar, kind: action-bar }
notes:                                         # rules in words — read, not checked
  - back goes in the bar's secondary button, never in the header
graduated_to: action-bar                       # the compound component the bar became
```

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| A skeleton template, not a rule language | the owner chose the smallest thing lint can check — the order and kind of a screen's top-level elements — over conditions like "no back in the header", which would need a language of their own. What lint cannot check is a note, shown on the page and read by the agent |
| One finding per screen and pattern, the first break | a cascade of findings after one misplaced element says nothing new; fix the first and the next shows |
| `applies_to` on the pattern, not a `pattern:` key on the screen | the screen that forgets is exactly the one a pattern exists for; binding by type, platform or name catches it without the screen's help |
| The draw prompt looks up patterns first (step 1½) | as in `fig:draw`: follow one that binds; with two or more precedents and no pattern, write the pattern first, behind its own yes; with nothing, a new pattern binds every later screen and is proposed on its own |
| A pattern graduates to a component | the kiosk's bar became `action-bar`; the pattern keeps the arrangement (where the bar goes), the contract keeps the part (what it is made of) |
| A proposal that changes a pattern shows the screens it would break | its lint after lists every L29 finding, not only those in the changed files |

## 5. Lint catalogue

Blocking stops handoff; warning is reported and counted. Each rule names the `fig` rule it descends from.

| id | severity | checks | from fig |
|---|---|---|---|
| L01 name-pattern | blocking | screen and section names match the patterns | naming |
| L02 section-exists | blocking | `section` is a row in sections.yaml | frame membership |
| L03 required-states | blocking | every state `required[type]` lists is present | placeholder / coverage |
| L04 unknown-state | warning | a state not in `states.known` | naming |
| L05 flow-target | blocking | `flows.to` resolves to a screen or screen.state | arrow coverage |
| L06 flow-source | warning | `flows.from` is an element; `via` is an anchor its kind declares | arrow entry |
| L07 patch-target | blocking | a state or variant patch targets an element or layout key that exists | — |
| L08 tbd-count | warning · blocking when overdue | every `$tbd`, grouped by owner | placeholder text |
| L09 refs-required | warning | the refs `refs.required` names are present | task_tracker link |
| L10 kind-known | warning | every `kind` has a `components/<kind>.yaml` | component residue (loosely) |
| L11 canonical-clean | blocking | on the canonical branch: no `$tbd`, no blocking findings | canonical strictness |
| L12 duplicate-id | blocking | ids unique across the project | — |
| L13 layout-vocabulary | blocking | `layout` uses only declared containers, size classes and token names; no bare units. Since 0.21 each grid track of `columns` too: a size class, a `size.`/`space.` token, `Nfr`, `auto`, `minmax(a, b)` over those — `320px` and a word css does not know are blocking, the track named | — (new) |
| L14 layout-orphan | warning | a `layout` key names an element that does not exist in that state | — (new) |
| L15 variant-shape | warning | a variant axis has ≥ 2 options; no option shares a name with a state | — (new) |
| L16 flow-vocabulary | warning | `gesture` and `nav` on a flow are words `conventions.flows` lists | arrow line styles |
| L17 platform-known | warning | a screen's `platform` is one `conventions.platforms` declares | — (new) |
| L18 token-missing | warning | a layout `gap` or `padding` names a token that resolves to nothing | — (new) |
| L19 token-primitive | blocking | a layout names a token from a file `conventions.tokens.primitive` lists | colour token binding (`fig:tokens`), moved from the canvas to the file |
| L20 token-problem | as the loader says | a broken alias, a `$ref` the resolver cannot open, a token one theme has and another does not | — (new) |
| L21 prop-undeclared | warning | an element, a replace patch or a set patch carries a prop its contract does not declare | component residue by property |
| L22 prop-invalid | blocking | a required prop is missing; an enum value is not an option; a slot is not declared | — (new) |
| L23 kinds-legacy | warning, one per project | rows still in `conventions.kinds` — `doan migrate kinds` | — (new) |
| L24 flow-orphan | warning | a screen no flow reaches or leaves, once the project has flows and more than one screen | coverage orphans |
| L25 asset-missing | warning | a `src` or `icon` that names a path under `assets/` with no such file | — (new) |
| L26 breakpoint-known | warning | a screen adapts to a breakpoint `conventions.breakpoints` does not name | — (new) |
| L27 ready-open | warning | a screen with status ready or done still holds a `$tbd` | — (new) |
| L28 slot-unknown | warning | a contract binds a token to a slot the picture does not read | — (new) |
| L29 pattern-skeleton | warning; blocking for a pattern file that is not one | a screen's top-level elements break the skeleton of a pattern that binds it — one finding per screen and pattern, the first break | `fig:draw` pattern page, now checked (§4.8) |
| L30 not-drawn | warning | a prop written in the file and declared by the contract that no drawing path reads — lint was green while the picture ignored the value. Lint runs the bundled drawing functions; a kind a library adapter draws is the contract-coverage test's (`test/coverage.test.js`), which drives every declared prop through the bundled set, antd and MUI. A prop meant for the documentation only says `drawn: false` with a reason. The viewer marks the same prop with a dot | — (new, 0.21) |

Not carried over: section bounds and overlap, arrow elbow geometry, component default residue by property. All are canvas geometry; none exists here.

## 6. Render is the product surface

`render` was a preview in v0.1. In v0.2 it is what people open.

```
Shell (every page)
 ├─ Sidebar      sections → screens, each with pills: blocking · $tbd · open comments; Overview + waiting proposals
 ├─ Main         screen title · state tabs (Default | Empty | …, variants by axis) · "compare states" toggle
 │               one state at a time, scaled to fit; compare = every state, shrunk into a grid
 │               below: flows · notes · comments · references
 └─ Drawer       closed until an element is clicked: id, kind, component it maps to, conditions,
                 props, "values are samples", file · path · line, copy, comments + comment box
```

Redesigned 2026-09-24 after the owner's first look ("the UX/UI is poor"). Four decisions, each asked one at a time: the shell above (Figma's own editor shape, so it needs no explanation); states as tabs with a compare toggle (one screen large by default, all of them when you ask); meta information as a dot on the picture — grey for a condition, yellow for an undecided value, blue for a comment — with the words in the drawer, so the picture stays a picture; and empty cells filled with sample values made from the column name ("amount" → 12,400, "paid_at" → a date), with the drawer saying they are samples. Also fixed: a leaf element (a tile grid) was inheriting its layout rule's grid and collapsing to one column.

Each `kind` resolves to a component: through `maps_to` when the team names a design system with a web build (antd, MUI, the team's own), otherwise the bundled default set — one tokenised HTML component per shipped `kind`. `layout` becomes CSS from tokens. Because the page is built from the production library, a developer inspecting it sees the real `Table` with its real props. That is the handoff: no redlines, no measurement, no picture.

Shipped 2026-09-23 (v0.2.1): the page is finite by rule — the **states row** renders every state with no variant chosen, in `states.known` order; each **variants row** renders every option of one axis in Default; no cross product. The inspector is one fixed panel filled by one delegated click handler: id, kind, `maps_to` name (or "bundled default"), props, file, YAML path, line, and a copy button for `file:line`. A `developer` toggle prints every element's path on the page. A `$tbd` renders as a dashed chip in place of the value; a `placeholder` as a dashed "undesigned" box carrying its owner and note; `show_when` / `disabled_when` as muted condition badges — printed, never evaluated. A `type: modal` screen sits centred on a dimmed backdrop. Every gap and padding is a token variable; the CSS carries no spacing number. Verified in a browser: click the table on `inventory-list` → `elements.1.children.1`, line 28, which is `- id: table` in the file.

Shipped 2026-09-23, later: the first adapter, `antd`. `--components antd` resolves each kind through `maps_to.antd` and renders that component server-side with React and antd's style extraction, themed from the project's tokens (primary, danger, text, border, radius, font). Children the bundled renderer produced are embedded as HTML, so a Card holds whatever is inside it. A kind with no mapping keeps the bundled drawing, and the inspector still shows path and line, because the wrapper is the same. Verified in a browser on the field-test screens: a real `ant-table`, `ant-segmented`, `ant-empty`, `ant-pagination`; the edit modal's Validation state with antd inputs and a disabled primary button. The libraries are optional dependencies, loaded only when asked for.

Decided 2026-09-23 after the antd adapter: **the tool never owns a team's components, and no library is required.** `init` asks for a base — `none` copies the bundled set into `design/components/kinds.js`, which is then the team's own component library, editable, 100% theirs; `antd` maps kinds to a library (others are listed as planned and refused until an adapter exists). `render` resolves the choice from `conventions.render`, a project-owned module first, then a library, then the bundled set. The bundled set is a starting point a team copies, not a dependency a team keeps.

What render will not offer, on purpose: drag, resize, nudge. (Since 0.18.1 the panel's *Layout* section lets a person pick a direction, a gap or padding token, an alignment or a width for the selected element — a value from the file's vocabulary, never a pixel — and that pick becomes a proposal that changes one line, `layout.<id>`, which the person applies like any other. The loop stays; there is a second way into it besides a sentence.) The moment a hand can move a box, the file and the picture can disagree, the diff stops being readable, and the product becomes one more canvas competing with three funded ones. The cost is real and named: a spacing change that would take one drag takes one sentence (§7).

### 6.4 The flow map

Shipped 2026-09-24 (0.5.0). The page Figma's flow page was: every screen of the product on one canvas, arrows between them, sections around them — except that nothing is placed by hand and nothing is stored. The files hold `flows:`; the layout is computed when the page is drawn.

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | ELK (`elkjs`, the layered algorithm), an optional dependency | the owner compared it with dagre. dagre is 1.4 MB and gives a spline through a few points; ELK is 8 MB and gives **ports** and **orthogonal routing** — a flow to `kiosk-menu.Selected` lands on the "Selected" row of that node, bends at right angles, and enters from the left, which is exactly the arrow discipline `fig:arrows` drew and `fig:lint` checked. The 8 MB is install cost only: layout runs in node at render time and the page carries the result. Without it the page says so and everything else works |
| A node | a screen: its name, type and platform; Default drawn small in the platform's proportions; one row per state | the thumbnail is the same drawing the screen page shows, scaled; a state is a row so an arrow has somewhere to land |
| An edge | one per resolving flow, from the screen's right edge to the target's row; label `from.via · gesture · nav · when`; `style: conditional` dashed | the label is the flow as written; the person reads the file's words, not a paraphrase |
| Grouping | a box per section, in `sections.yaml` order; ELK places boxes as compound nodes and routes across them | sections are the product's own grouping; no second grouping to keep in sync |
| Coordinates | none stored, none adjustable | the owner chose auto-layout over saved positions: a map that re-draws from the files cannot drift from them |
| Dead ends and orphans | listed under the map; L24 warns on a screen no flow reaches or leaves | `fig:lint`'s coverage-orphan check, moved from the canvas to the graph |

Nodes are HTML (so an adapter's thumbnail is the real thing) and the edges are one SVG on top. A thumbnail may itself contain links (antd's pagination does), so a node is a `div` with a link in its head, not a link. `list_flows` (verb and MCP tool) is the same graph as JSON — edges, dead ends, orphans — for an agent that wants the structure without the picture.

Since 2026-09-24 the map is a section of the overview, not a page of its own: the owner asked why a flow view existed beside a canvas that already draws a domain's flows, and it was one thing twice. The canvas holds a domain's flows at real size; the overview holds the map of every domain, with the flows to nowhere and the screens no flow reaches under it, and `index.html#<domain>` lights that domain in it.

### 6.5 The click-through prototype

Since 2026-09-25 the prototype selects nothing: a click follows a flow and does nothing else, the inspect panel says where the prototype is and lists the flows that leave this screen, and an element with several flows asks which — the owner found a click that also selected the element confusing, and Figma's present mode does not select either. Elements are selected on the canvas.


Shipped 2026-09-24 (0.6.0). `proto.html` holds every screen in every state and shows one; the elements a flow leaves from are hotspots, and pressing one lands on the flow's target screen and state. That is the whole scope — the owner set it when the stages were planned: the product's navigation, pressed, from the files alone. Typing, validation and branching on input are `fig:proto`'s job, and stay there.

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| What is pressable | exactly the `from` elements of the screen's flows, every instance of them (a repeated card is eight hotspots) | the prototype proves the flows, not the widgets |
| `modal` and `sheet` | the target is laid over the current screen; `dismiss` and `back` pop; `replace` swaps | the same words the flow vocabulary already has, acted out |
| Several flows from one element | a chooser lists them; a conditional flow is dashed in it | two listeners on one element would fire both. The person picks the branch, which is what a condition means |
| Where you start | the URL: `proto.html#screen` or `#screen.State`; the flow map's ▶ and the screen page's button link there | a review can be sent as a link that opens on the screen in question |
| Hotspots visible | on by default, a toggle to hide | shown, it is a map of what the file says is pressable; hidden, it is the picture |

Everything on the page is the same drawing the screen page shows, so a library adapter's components and a compound part look the same here. Nothing is stored and nothing is generated per project: the page is `render` output like the rest.


**Every state has a way out (0.15.2).** The owner asked that a prototype run end to end. Two things stood in the way: a flow could not say which state it leaves from, so a Loading screen offered the Default screen's buttons or nothing, and `timeout` flows never played. A flow now carries `in:` (the states it leaves from) and the prototype plays a timeout after a short beat, showing the flow's `when`; a disabled element is no hotspot.

### 6.6 The domain canvas

Shipped 2026-09-24 (0.7.0). After the four stages the owner looked at the viewer next to a Figma file kept with the `fig` skills and said what was missing: *a page per domain, the domain's screens laid out together, the flow drawn among them*. That page is what a designer opens first; a screen page and a thumbnail map are not it. So the canvas is the viewer's first surface now, and it follows fig's own conventions for a Figma page — the ones `fig:prep` laid out and `fig:lint` checked — because that is the shape the owner's eye already reads.

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The unit | one canvas per domain; a domain is what a section name says before " - " (`NN. {domain} - {feature}`), a section with no dash is its own | fig's section shape, read backwards. No new field: `sections.yaml` already carries it |
| Inside a section | fig's rule — row 1 is the happy path left to right, a screen's other states stacked under its Default, sections of a domain in one row | predictable, and the same picture as the Figma page. ELK's auto-layout was the alternative; it reorders screens as flows change and cannot stack states, so the owner chose fig's rule |
| Happy path | the entry screen first — fewest arrivals, most departures, a `back`/`dismiss` flow not counting as an arrival, a list or page before a form or modal on a tie — then what its flows reach, breadth first | every screen of a loop has something arriving; what a person picks by eye is the first screen the flow leaves from |
| Size | real size, zoom (⌘/ctrl + wheel, pinch, buttons) and pan (wheel, drag), fit on open | a canvas at real size is what "look at the design" means; thumbnails are the flow map's job |
| Arrows | drawn by the page from what it measures, by fig's rules: leave the source Default's right edge at the trigger element's height (edge midpoint when the element is not on the frame), right-angle elbow, a gap before the head, enter the target state frame's left edge at its midpoint; a flow that goes back climbs into a corridor above both frames and comes down the gap beside the target; `[state]` dashed chains between stacked frames; conditional dashed; label pills | the engine renders the frames but does not know their heights until they are drawn, so the arrows belong to the browser. The rules are `fig:arrows`' geometry, minus frame avoidance beyond the corridor |
| Comments | an element's comment goes to the screen whose frame it sits in | one canvas holds many screens; the inspector reads the frame |
| Other domains | a flow leaving the domain is a stub with a link to that canvas | the page stays one domain; the map stays the place for everything |

Not stored: nothing about the canvas is written anywhere. Positions come from CSS, arrows from measurement, order from flows. Change a file and the page changes.

### 6.7 The workspace — the viewer measured against Figma's

Shipped 2026-09-24 (0.8.0). The canvas was right in structure and still felt like a page, not a tool. The owner named the standard: *to replace Figma for looking at the canonical design, the viewer has to follow what Figma's viewer and Dev Mode do, and how they feel* — editing aside. The gap table lives in the session that set it; the first cut is the workspace shape, because every later piece (inspect, status, comments) hangs on it.

| Figma | Here (0.8) | Left for later |
|---|---|---|
| One window: pages and layers left, canvas centre, properties right, always | the canvas page is that window: a tree on the left (domain → section → screen → state, the selected frame's element layers under it), the canvas, an inspect panel that stays open with an empty state | the other pages keep their drawer; the tree spans domains by link, not in one document (a project of hundreds of frames would not fit one page — deferred rendering is §13) |
| Hover outlines, click to select, Esc | the innermost element under the cursor outlines; a click selects it (frame or element); Esc clears; the tree row and the frame follow the selection | multi-select, arrow-key traversal |
| Shift 1 fit · Shift 2 zoom to selection · Shift 0 100% · ⌘± · pinch · ⌘F | the same keys, the same meanings | zoom to a section, rulers, pixel grid |
| A link to a node | `#screen.State/elements.1` opens the canvas zoomed to that element, selected; a selection writes the hash | a link that survives a rename (ids do; paths do not) |
| Pages · prototype · dev mode as modes of one file | the modes on every page: Canvas · Prototype, the flow map a section of the overview | one document, one URL, modes as state |

The rule behind the choices: the viewer's chrome follows Figma where a person's hands already know it (keys, panels, hover, Esc) and follows the files where Figma has nothing (a tree of states, a flow list on a frame, a path in the hash).

### 6.8 The navigation, defined once

The owner's second look at 0.8 found the menus changing under the cursor: the canvas had one sidebar, the other pages another; modes sat on the top bar on one page and in the sidebar foot on the next; the flow map opened with a different left side than the canvas it was opened from. So the navigation is defined once, here, and every page wears the same one. A page differs from another only in its title, its tools and its content.

| Slot | Holds | Never holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Left** — content | the project name; then the overview, then the design system — tokens · components · assets (§6.9) — because the screens are built from them, so they come first (the owner's rule, 2026-09-24); then a search box (⌘F) and the domain tree — domain › section › screen › state, the current domain open, the others folded behind a caret | a mode. A link to the prototype does not belong here |
| **Top, left** — where you are | the page title and its meta. The bar is three columns, the modes in the middle and the two sides sharing the rest equally, so the modes are centred on every page and nothing beside them can push them (the owner's rule, 2026-09-24: nothing up here moves between pages). A long meta truncates, its full text on hover; wide tools wrap rather than push | tools |
| **Top, centre** — the modes | Canvas · Prototype, always both, always here — Figma's Design · Prototype; the one that applies is lit, on a page that is neither nothing is lit. The prototype keeps its context: it opens on the selected frame. The flow map is not a mode — the canvas already draws a domain's flows — but a section of the overview (§6.4) | a third item |
| **Top, right** — this page's tools | zoom and the arrows toggle on the canvas; compare and paths on a screen page; the prototype's screen and state selects; the theme select last, on every page | navigation |
| **Right** — the inspect panel | always present: an empty state until something is selected | anything but the selection |

A screen in the tree links to its frame on the canvas — the canvas is where a screen is looked at; the screen page (states side by side, compare) is reached from the panel. The tree's folding and search are the same script on every page; the canvas adds only what a frame on the same canvas can do in place (select, zoom). A page the server could not place — the overview opened at a domain (`index.html#domain`) and the prototype carry their place in the hash — folds the tree from the hash on load and as it changes, and points the three modes at that place, so switching modes never collapses the tree or loses the domain. The shell folds for narrow windows (2026-09-25): under 1180px the inspect panel is hidden behind a Panel button and opens by itself on a selection, under 860px the sidebar is hidden behind a menu button, the top bar goes to two rows with the modes centred on the second, and the tokens page to one column.

### 6.9 The design system's pages: tokens and assets

The sidebar's design system has three pages, above the tree because the screens are built from them (§6.8): tokens, components (§4.5), assets.

**tokens.html** is laid out like Figma's variables modal — the owner's ask, 2026-09-24. Left, the collections and the groups of the one shown; right, that collection's table, one at a time. A collection is a base set's file (one value column) or a resolver modifier — `theme`, whose contexts light and dark are its mode columns, the way a Figma collection carries its modes; the bundled set comes last when a token lives only there. Rows sit under a heading per group (the first path segment), the name shows its leaf with a type mark, and a value written as an alias is a chip with the alias's name and colour, the way Figma shows a linked variable. A search box and the group list filter the rows. A row opens the token in the inspect panel: every mode's value, the alias chain resolved step by step, the CSS variable, and links to the components (through their bindings) and screens (through layout gap and padding) that use it; `#t:<name>` deep-links to the row, `#c:<collection>` to a collection. A flat `tokens.json` is one collection; the resolver's problems are listed on top.

**assets.html** is a card per file under its folder — the picture, its size, the natural dimensions the browser reads, who names it — then the references that name no file (L25's data) and the files nothing names. A card opens in the inspect panel; `#a:<path>` deep-links to it. An empty folder says where files go.

Both pages fold the tree from the hash like every hash-placed page, and their deep links are prefixed (`t:`, `a:`) so the tree's screen lookup never mistakes one for a screen.

### 6.10 Handoff: the spec a developer — or a developer's agent — builds from

Decided 2026-09-25, when the owner said that a tool which skips Figma has to be more developer-friendly than Figma, not less. The baseline is Figma's Dev Mode with Code Connect — design components mapped to code components — and its Dev Mode MCP server, through which Claude Code and Cursor read a component tree, variables and mappings as structured context ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-mcp-server/), [Code Connect](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/23920389749655-Code-Connect)). The 2026 default flow is Figma → Code Connect → MCP → an AI editor → a person polishing ([sanjaytarani](https://sanjaytarani.com/blog/top-design-handoff-tools-in-2026-bridging-the-gap-between-design-and-development)), and what developers say they need beyond measurements is the states a static frame cannot show ([Storyflow](https://storyflow.so/blog/design-handoff-checklist)).

doan's answer is a spec, not a picture: `spec-<screen>.html` for a person, `doan spec` and the MCP `handoff` tool for an agent — one structure (src/spec.js) read off the file each time. Elements with props and copy and the component each maps to in the team's code; what every state, variant and breakpoint changes; the flows out; the tokens used, with the CSS variable each becomes; the assets; the open `$tbd` questions; and acceptance criteria written from all of that, one line per promise the file makes. The Markdown form is a ticket, the JSON form is what a coding agent reads before it writes. Code Connect's counterpart is `maps_to.code` in a contract — `import`, `name`, and how this kind's props and values become the component's — from which every element gets a framework-neutral snippet, shown in the spec and in the inspector. Tokens leave as `doan tokens --format css` (the viewer's own custom properties, a block per theme) or `--format tailwind`. A screen says where it is for developers with `status: draft | ready | done`, shown in the overview and the tree; L27 warns when a ready screen still holds a `$tbd`.

Not built, on purpose: code generation. An agent that has the spec writes better code than a generator that has the picture, and Figma's own generated code is labelled "not production-ready". Measurements (E2) come next; the HTML being real makes them less urgent here than in Figma.

### 6.11 The style stage: what the product looks like, decided before screens

Decided 2026-09-27, when the owner looked at a burger-kiosk reference beside the sample and said the tool was good at structure but had no step where a style is defined. A review of the loop found the same shape everywhere: every stage needs an interview, a file, a page, lint and propose→apply, and only screens had all five. Style, components and assets were files the agent wrote by hand — which is why round after round looked like the agent's taste.

| Stage | Interview | File | Page | Lint | Propose → apply |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foundations | `foundation` prompt | `tokens/` — colour roles, `text.*` text styles (DTCG typography), `surface.*`, scales, fonts | `foundations.html` — board and variables tabs | L18–L20, L28 | `propose_files` |
| Components | `component` prompt | `components/<kind>.yaml` | components (samples in every variant) | L21, L22, L28 | `propose_files` |
| Patterns | `draw` prompt, step 1½ | `patterns/<name>.yaml` | patterns (skeleton, rules, who follows) | L29 | `propose_files` |
| Assets | — | `assets/**` (svg through proposals) | assets | L25 | `propose_files` |
| Screens | `draw` prompt | `screens/*.yaml` | screen, canvas | all | `propose` |

- **Text styles and surfaces.** A text style is one DTCG typography token and five CSS values (`text.heading.font-size` …); a surface is a group — bg, border, radius, shadow, text, padding. A contract binds a whole one with `font: text.heading` or `surface: surface.tile`, on the kind or on a part (`label.font:`). The bundled set ships display · heading · title · body · label · caption and page · card · raised · sunken. A text style may also carry `textCase` (Figma's Case: `original` · `upper` · `lower` · `title`, 0.20.0) — DTCG has no letter case, but a label that is always in capitals is a fact of the style, not of every string written into it, so the file keeps the words as written and the style turns them.
- **Fonts.** `assets/fonts/<Family>-<Weight>.woff2` becomes `@font-face`; a stylesheet URL in `conventions.render.fonts` becomes a link.
- **Foundations are the base of the design system (0.15).** The owner pointed out that style is not a stage beside the design system but its bottom layer: foundations (tokens) → components (contracts) → screens, assets beside. The viewer says so — Design system › Foundations (the board, with the variables table as its second tab), Components (each sample in every variant), Assets; the old style and tokens entries are one. The interview is `foundation`.
- **The board.** One page: each text style set in its own type, colours, surfaces, scales, every component's sample in every variant — drawn with the project's tokens, inside the viewer's own chrome.
- **Icons follow their element.** An svg icon is a mask filled with the text colour, so a selected tile's icon turns white with its label.
- **Comments on a frame.** A comment may be on a screen as a whole, with the state it was left on; the canvas frame panel lists them and takes one.

## 7. The edit loop — "by conversation only"

A change enters as a comment or a chat message, anchored to what the person is looking at.

```
person    "table: drop the branch column"        (comment on the table, or chat)
agent     reads screen + conventions + comment
          proposes a patch: YAML diff + re-rendered screen, lint result attached
person    approves · edits the request · rejects
tool      applies to the working branch, re-renders, resolves the comment with a link to the commit
```

One tier rule so a typo does not cost a round trip: changes in `edit.auto_apply` (default: `text` — copy, labels, titles) that pass lint apply immediately, with undo. Everything else — elements, layout, states, flows — previews first. The owner chose conversation-only editing on 2026-09-23 knowing the cost; this rule is the floor under it.

Since 2026-09-25 `propose` also takes a screen the project does not have: the proposal creates `screens/<name>.yaml`, always pending, and `undo` removes the file. Since the same day a proposal names the comments it answers (`comments`, plus any id mentioned in its summary or decisions); applying it resolves them with the approver's name, an auto-applied text change resolves them as "auto", and undo reopens them — closing the comment, the loop's last step, no longer needs a hand. Shipped 2026-09-23: `propose(screen, after)` takes the whole new YAML text — not a patch language, because an agent already writes whole files well and a patch language is one more thing to get wrong. The proposal stores the base file's hash; `apply` refuses if the file moved since. The tier is read off the diff: every changed path ending in a text prop (`text`, `label`, `title`, `placeholder`, `caption`, `hint`, `note`, `when`) or under `notes` is `text`; anything else is `structure`. `edit.auto_apply` names the tiers that skip the person; a tier still waits if lint after would block. Proposals are files under `.proposals/`, so the CLI, the MCP server and a future viewer share one queue. The MCP `apply` tool needs `approved_by` and its description tells the agent not to call it on its own — that is a convention, not a lock; the lock is that a person can always `undo`, and that the viewer (when it exists) is where approval is meant to happen.

Shipped later the same day — the sketch step. `fig:draw` agrees the direction in the conversation before a single node is written: the list of what must be decided, one question at a time with a recommendation, a table once settled, a text wireframe per state. The first cut dropped the wireframe on the theory that the real thing could replace it, since nothing is written until `apply`. The owner reversed that on 2026-09-24 after the first session that drew screens without one: the agent went straight from the decisions table to a rendered proposal, and the person had to argue with a diff and a picture instead of a sketch. So the wireframe stays, in the conversation, before any YAML — a box drawing of Default at the platform's proportions and one line per state — and the person says yes to it first. A wireframe is cheaper to argue with than a diff. After the yes, a proposal carries `decisions: [{ item, decision, why }]`, and `render` draws every pending proposal as a page — decisions, then the diff, then every state AS-IS beside TO-BE, with the inspector. The interview itself is agent behaviour, so the MCP server publishes it as the `draw` prompt: any agent that connects gets the same seven steps (anchor → list decisions → ask one at a time → table → wireframe and a yes → propose with decisions → render and wait). A proposal that arrives with no decisions renders with a line saying so — the page shows when the interview was skipped.

The agent behind the loop is not part of this project. The tool exposes MCP verbs (§9) and a comment feed; Claude Code, Codex or a hosted agent drives them. This keeps the tool small and lets a team bring the agent it already pays for.


### 7.4 Files: the style, the components, the assets

The loop reaches the rest of the design the same way (0.14). `propose_files` (CLI `propose <dir> --files path=local,…`) carries whole new texts for `tokens.json`, `tokens/*.json`, `components/*.yaml`, `assets/**/*.svg`, `conventions.yaml` and `sections.yaml` — several in one proposal. The project as it would be is loaded from a temporary copy and linted; nothing is written until a person applies it; apply refuses if any file changed since; undo puts every file back and removes the ones it created. Always pending: a style change is never "text only". The proposal page shows the style board as it is beside as it would be, each in its own frame so the two token sets never meet, then each file AS-IS beside TO-BE with changed lines marked.

### 7.5 Asking from the viewer

Decided 2026-09-28: the owner did not want to go to the terminal to type "apply the comments" every time. The viewer cannot call an agent — any agent, since doan is not tied to one — so the foot of the live viewer's right panel — fixed, beside where comments are written, the viewer's own primary button — says how many are open and asks the agent, and pressing it writes a request to `<project>/.requests/requests.json`. An agent watching the project takes it: reads the comments, proposes, and closes the request with the proposal ids (`list_requests`, `close_request`; `doan requests` exits 3 while one is open, for a shell watcher). The button waits while the request is open and says the proposals are in when it closes; the person applies them in the viewer as ever. One open request per kind — pressing twice asks once.

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| A request queue, not the viewer starting an agent | the owner chose the live session: it keeps the conversation's context and the person's rules; a request left when no session is watching waits for the next one. Starting `claude -p` from the server would tie doan to one agent and spend tokens out of sight |
| The agent never applies | the button asks for proposals; the viewer's Apply stays the person's yes |
| "The agent is on it" only when one is (0.21) | the first-time-user pass met the waiting text with no agent anywhere, and it never went away. The MCP server, while its process lives, rewrites `.requests/agent.json` (`{pid, started, seen}`) every 20 s; the viewer counts an agent as connected when `seen` is under a minute old, and with none says "No agent connected", how to connect one, and that the request waits. A stopped agent goes stale on its own; nothing has to clean up. The file sits beside the queue it serves, not in a new folder, and `init`'s `.gitignore` keeps it out of git |

## 8. Lifecycle

```
derived status      git                        what the tool shows
─────────────       ──────────────────────     ────────────────────────────────────
working             feature branch             preview link for that branch
queue               PR open, lint passing      PR comment: preview link + lint summary
canonical           merged to main             the project page; L11 enforced
archived            git history                version picker on the screen page
```

Status is derived, never stored — a stored field drifts. The PR view is what `fig` built with divider groups and `[Update]` pages: what shipped and is not yet canonical, side by side with what is.

## 9. Verbs — one set, three surfaces

The CLI is for CI. MCP is for the agent. The viewer is for people. Same verbs, same JSON.

| verb | does | writes |
|---|---|---|
| `lint` | findings with file path + YAML path | no |
| `prep <screen>` | stubs required states as `placeholder` patches carrying `$tbd`, on one element (`--target`, default the first); comments and order kept | that file |
| `diff <a> <b>` · `diff <file> --from <ref>` | AS-IS/TO-BE table; elements by id (a reorder is one row), scalar lists as one value, object lists by index; later rendered side by side in the viewer | no |
| `render` | the viewer's pages (static build, or served) | `out/` |
| `propose <screen> <after>` · `apply <id> --by` · `reject <id>` · `undo <id>` · `proposals` | the edit loop (§7): diff + lint delta + tier; text-only auto-applies; structure waits for a person | that file, and `.proposals/` |
| `rename <old> <new>` — *planned* | file and every reference | project |
| `import html <dir>` — *planned* | Claude Design / Open Design / any HTML export → screen files: `kind` by reverse `maps_to` on component markup, `layout` from flex/grid structure, unresolved → `$tbd` | new files |
| `map figma <key> --page [--write]` | the page's component masters (sets) paired with kinds by name → `maps_to.figma` in `components/<kind>.yaml` (the conventions row for a project from before 0.4); unplaced masters listed | component files |
| `tokens` | every token with its value, per-theme values, file and tier | no |
| `comments` · `requests` · `requests close <id>` | what people left in the viewer, what they asked from it, and closing a request once an agent has answered it (§7.5) | `.requests/` |
| `components` | every contract — props, slots, bindings, compound or not | no |
| `migrate kinds` | the rows of `conventions.kinds` → `components/<kind>.yaml`, the block dropped | components/, conventions.yaml |
| `import figma <key> --page` | on-ramp for a team already drawing, over the REST API: `{screen}-{state}` frames → files, other states as patches by diffing element trees; `kind` by `maps_to.figma` on the master name, then by node-name hints; `layout` from auto-layout in token names; flows from prototype links; scaffold frames (`[label]`, `-->`) skipped; unresolved → `$tbd` owned by `import`; required states nobody drew → placeholders; no convention at all → one screen per top-level frame, flagged | new files, sections.yaml |
| `import tokens <variables-dir>` | the team's Figma Variables export (one JSON per collection — collection, modes, variables) → `tokens/`: primitives bare, every other collection under a prefix (`xds.color.text.primary` ↔ `color/text/primary`, so the file and the code that reads the export meet on one name), a multi-mode collection a resolver modifier with one file per mode, and doan's own names an alias layer into it — by `--map` over a default pairing; what nothing covers keeps the bundled value and is listed. First run 2026-10-08 on a 337-variable export: 409 tokens, two modifiers (colour × 4, type × 3) | tokens/ |
| `export <adapter>` — *planned* | Figma / `.pen` / `.op` for teams that still need a canvas elsewhere | adapter target |

MCP adds `list_screens()`, `get_screen(screen, state, variants)` (merged view), `list_missing()` (L03/L08 only), `list_tokens()`, `list_components()` and `list_flows()`, because agents ask those most. Shipped 2026-09-23: `src/mcp.js` on stdio via the official SDK; every tool returns the verb's JSON as `structuredContent` and as text, errors as `isError` with a readable message; one implementation per verb in `src/verbs.js` serves CLI and MCP alike.

## 10. The service

The engine (§3–§9) is open source and runs locally. The service is the engine hosted, which is what makes it a tool a team opens instead of Figma:

Shipped 2026-09-24 as `serve`: a local viewer that renders from the files on every request and adds the three things a static page cannot do — a comment box in the inspector (a comment is a screen + a YAML path + a text, stored in `.comments/<screen>.json`, shown as a badge on the element and as "N open" on the index), Apply / Reject on a proposal page with the approver's name, and `/api/lint`, `/api/proposals`, `/api/comments` for a bot or an agent. The MCP server reads and resolves comments, so the loop closes: a person comments on the page, the agent proposes, the person applies on the page, the agent resolves the comment naming the proposal. Verified in a browser by doing exactly that. Hosting is this process behind a URL per branch.

| Layer | What a person sees |
|---|---|
| Hosted viewer | the project page, always current with `main` |
| Per-branch preview | every PR gets a URL; reviewers look, not `git checkout` |
| Lint bot | a PR comment: missing states, dead flows, overdue `$tbd` |
| Comment → agent | comments on the viewer reach the agent; replies carry the diff and the preview |
| Fixed share links | screen + state + version, stable enough to paste into a ticket |
| Handoff | a link engineering opens; inspect real components; the version is pinned |

"Light" still means the same thing for a new team: put YAML files in a folder, run `lint`, open the viewer. No account until they want the hosted one; no canvas ever.

## 11. Relationship to `fig` and `pm`

- `fig` keeps running for teams on Figma. Its rules are this engine's rules; its Figma-only code stays there. Migration is `import figma` here.
- `pm:prd` writes what `refs.prd` points at; `pm:task-publish` opens what `refs.task` points at. Links are URIs; neither needs to know this exists.
- `fig:deck`, `fig:proto`, `fig:code`: `proto` becomes redundant (the render is clickable); `code` reads the screen file instead of Figma; `deck` stays on Figma Slides.

## 12. Field test — six real screens (2026-09-23)

Six screens of a working store-operations admin were transcribed into the format under generic names (`examples/store-ops`): an inventory list, its edit modal, a payment list with an inline detail, a notice create/edit modal with a delete confirm, a fleet dashboard, and a tabbed settings page. The structure came from the code, not from a mockup, so every conditional, timed and role-gated behaviour the code has was written down or noted as missing.

What it found, in the order it hurt:

| # | Finding | Kind | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The engine only saw top-level elements. Every real screen nests (card → filter → button; header → actions), so patches, flows and layout keys all missed — 20 blocking, 27 warnings on the first run | engine bug | fixed: an element is any `{id, kind}` object wherever it sits; merge, L06, L07, L10, L14 walk the tree |
| 2 | Prose values with commas in flow-style YAML (`{ when: Cancel, X or backdrop }`) parse as stray keys and fail the schema with a baffling message | authoring trap | schema errors now hint "quote the whole value"; the examples use block style for prose |
| 3 | Three of six screens have **variants** that are not lifecycle states: an edit modal that behaves as counted / cup-lid / other; a dialog that is Create or Edit; a home whose button reads Register or Edit by data | format gap | done: `variants:` (§4.2), L15; the three screens rewritten. Custom period stayed a state — it is reached by an action |
| 4 | Conditional visibility recurs on four of six screens: `show_when`, `disabled_when`, and a radio option that *reveals* its own control | format gap | accepted as element props for now (`show_when`, `disabled_when`, `reveals`); render and lint do nothing with them yet |
| 5 | Derived values (quantity = max × level, auto-filled max until edited), timed transitions (a 7-second overlay before reload), and role checks on button press rather than by hiding | not expressible | `notes:` — deliberately. These are behaviour, not screen structure; the format records that they exist, and the spec owns them |
| 6 | Responsive changes (3 columns → 2 on small; a stat strip that scrolls sideways) | format gap | done 2026-09-25: `breakpoints:` patches and `columns: auto` · `wrap` · `scroll: horizontal` (§4.7) |
| 7 | A detail shown under the list on the same page | awkward but works | a hidden element revealed by a `Selected` state |
| 8 | Modals as their own screen files (`type: modal`, `refs.parent`) with flows from the parent | works | keep |
| 9 | Two empty-state variants — "no data" vs "no match when filtered" — on every list | works | a team adds `NoMatch` to `states.known`; shows the extension point does its job |
| 10 | Button rows needed a bare container; `row` was a layout container, not an element kind | vocabulary | `group` kind added to the shipped set |

After the fixes: 6 screens, 0 blocking, 2 warnings — both `$tbd`, both real (an error state the build does not have; a help caption nobody captured).

### 12.1 Import field test (2026-09-24)

`import figma` was run against two real pages of the same company's files, read-only, output not committed. A page with **no naming convention** (every frame called by the product's name, groups called "3dots") imported zero screens until the fallback existed; with it, every top-level frame became a screen named by position and flagged — correct, and useless until a person names them. A page **kept by `fig`** (frames `{screen}-{state}`, sections `NN. domain - feature`, arrows drawn by `fig:arrows`) imported 10 "screens" on the first run, five of them arrow labels (`[label] A --> B`) — scaffold frames are now skipped by default — and blocked on Korean screen names until the pattern took `\p{L}` (the lint now compiles patterns with the `u` flag; the example says how). After that: 5 screens, 0 blocking, 954 warnings, of which 468 are `$tbd` — almost every element is `kind: frame` because the file's component masters are not in `maps_to.figma` and the layer names ("navigation", "right", "wrapper", "contents") say nothing a hint can read. That is the honest shape of an import from a file that was never written for this format: the structure and the states come across, the vocabulary does not, and the agent's next job is to walk the `$tbd` list with a person. Filling `maps_to.figma` from the design system's master names is what turns the ratio around, and is the first thing a team should do before importing — so `map figma` now does it: it reads the masters a page uses (variants collapsed into their component set), pairs each with a kind by name, and writes the pairs as lists into `conventions.yaml`. Three more things the same page taught, all now in the importer: a run of instances of one master (100 dashboard tiles) is one element with `repeat: 100`, not a hundred elements; a layer named by where it sits (`wrapper`, `contents`, `Frame 483913`) is a bare `group`, not an open question; a variant's own name is `type=primary`, so the resolver reads the component set's name. After all four: the same page, 5 screens, 0 blocking, **80 `$tbd`** (from 468) — 64 of them one master, `graph-item`, that no name hint can place and a person names once.

## 13. TBD

| Item | Owner | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Proposal records | decided | a proposal names its file relative to the project (0.12.1). With an absolute path, applying a proposal inside a copy of the project wrote into the original — found while previewing the kiosk screens in a scratch copy |
| Handoff: measurements and generation | design | the spec (§6.10, 0.11.0) carries no measured sizes — E2 inspect measurements come next; code generation stays out on purpose, an agent with the spec writes it. An adapter still maps enum options to its own props in code, not from `maps_to.code` |
| Inline SVG icons | decided | 0.14: an svg icon is drawn as a css mask in the text colour (no inlining, no script to strip); a multi-colour svg under icons/ loses its colours — put it under photos/ |
| Inline SVG icons (old) | design | an SVG drawn through `<img>` cannot take the text colour (§4.6); inline it — strip `<script>`, `fill: currentColor` — when a team needs themed icons |
| Name | user | `doan` undersells a product; GitHub redirects after a rename |
| Core language | decided | Node (2026-09-23): MCP ecosystem, the viewer is web, `fig`'s scripts are JS. Deps: `yaml` (keeps line positions for findings) and `ajv` |
| Default component set | design | which `kind`s ship a bundled component and how far their styling goes |
| Layout vocabulary depth | design | stack/grid/columns + tokens, then `columns: auto`·`min`·`wrap`·`scroll` and breakpoints (§4.7, 2026-09-25), then fixed-axis `align`/`justify` and track lists (0.13.0). Responsive typography and per-breakpoint tokens are the next axis |
| Adapter theme per mode | design | antd and MUI pieces are themed once, from the default context (§4.4). Render per context when a team asks; it is one SSR pass per theme |
| Adapter reads the contract | decided | since 0.10.1 every element is drawn with its contract applied (defaults, enum fallback) and a contract's bindings theme an adapter root through `--k-` variables (§4.5). Still open: an adapter mapping enum options to its own props (variant → antd `type`) from the contract rather than code |
| Contracts from Figma component sets | later | `map figma` pairs masters; a set's variant properties could fill a contract's enum options and its bound variables the bindings |
| Canvas arrow avoidance | design | the corridor keeps a back-flow off the frames above its target; a forward flow to a farther column can still cross a frame between. `fig:arrows`' detour rule is the model |
| Canvas layout tokens | design | column gap 160, frame gap 96, section padding 96, section gap 240 are fixed in css; fig measures them per team (`layout.column_grid` …). A `canvas:` block in conventions when a team asks |
| Platform / breakpoint variants | decided | a `breakpoints:` block of patches, one file per screen (§4.7, 2026-09-25); one file per platform rejected — the copies drift |
| Copy as literal vs key | design | `text: "…"` today; `text: { key: orders.empty }` for i18n teams |
| Comment storage | decided | a file per screen under `.comments/` in the repo (2026-09-24) — travels with the branch, one store for the local viewer, the MCP server and a hosted viewer; anchored by element id since 0.10.1 — a YAML path moves when something is inserted above it, an id does not |
| Agent runtime for the hosted loop | later | bring-your-own (Claude Code, Codex via MCP) first; a hosted agent is a pricing decision, not a design one |
